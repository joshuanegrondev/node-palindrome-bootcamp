### Goal: Create a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules to validate if a string is a palindrome server side.

### Tech used: HTML5, CSS3, JS ES6, and Node.JS

## How I made it:

-Set up server that will send HTML5, CSS3, and JS ES6  upon request
-Made a text input field and a button that handles an event listener
-When clicked, the event listener would take the value of the input and use that to search the query in a fetch request to the server
-Then the server performs a palindrome check and send back response
-The response is then appended to the page for the user to see
